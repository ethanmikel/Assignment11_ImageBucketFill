"""
This module contains adjacency list representations of various graphs.
This module is used for the test suite to check your code.

Each graph is defined as a dictionary where:
    - The key is the vertex ID (integer).
    - The value is a tuple: (color, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, edges).
    - `edges` is a list of integers representing connections to other vertices.
